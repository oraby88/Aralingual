    "whereArabic-heading": "Where Do They Speak Arabic?",
    "whereArabic-paragraph": "The governments of 22 countries recognize Arabic language as their official language. Arabic is the 5th most popular language worldwide with about 6% of the world’s population (450Million). Saudi Arabia leads the most appealing Arabic-speaking market, and they are followed by Kuwait, UAE, and Bahrain. So, you see why video game translation is important!",
    "whyArabicMarket-heading": "Why Game Translation | Why Should Games be Localized to Arabic-Speaking Markets?",
    "whyArabicMarket-paragraph1": "Video game Localization is to be prioritized to get a foothold in the Middle East. Below are the reasons you need to gain the lucrative assets available in the Middle East! The ARPPU in KSA is $270, and it’s the highest in the world.The common name called “killer whales” in the game developer world was given to some of the 40% of Saudi gamers that spend about $1000 monthly. The entire 40% pay for in-app purchases. Meanwhile, the Chinese users or gamers bring $32 compared to KSA’s $270.",
    "whyArabicMarket-paragraph2": "The vast number of the Arab population are young! They are below 25 years old, and this generation are tech-savvy and exposed to hedonistic things most of the time. For instance, there are internet cafes in Beirut where natives play AAA shooters just like Call of Duty.",
    "whyArabicMarket-paragraph3": "The smartphone has penetrated into the most developed Arabic country! Just in 2019, about 46% usage was seen in Saudi Arabia. It holds massive potential as well as opportunities for mobile games. So, video game translation or game localization is the key to success.",
    "whatDifficulties-question": "What Are The Difficulties Present In The Arabic Market?",
    "whatDifficulties-paragraph1": "It is important to take cognizance of the fact that online transaction support, internet speed as well as average income differs from one county to another. Despite considering this varying factor, it is also good to know the lucrative smaller populations. For instance, the Arabian Gulf states are regarded as the smallest when it comes to population, but the market there is more appealing than that of Northern African - Morocco and Egypt.",
    "whatDifficulties-paragraph2": "This means that markets must be analyzed and evaluated independent of the other by international game development companies. That is, video game localization companies should evaluate them independently based on design, game genre and the monetization model.",
    "whatDifficulties-paragraph3": "Some years back, piracy was a thing in the games market in the Arab World. However, it is nothing to worry about now. With access to Steam, Xbox, PlayStation and app stores, there is an increase in affordability and accessibility of foreign games. More so, Arabic gamers demand professional localization and do not like low-quality translated games.",
    "whatDifficulties-paragraph4": "At the forefront of content localization into Arabic from English were MMO games. The likes of Ubisoft, EA, Sony and other western developers at least provided Arabic subtitles and localized some of their games to Arabic. Examples include: Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, FIFA, Assassin’s Creed, The Division, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy and so on.",
    "whatDifficulties-paragraph5": "Ubisoft localized the game “The Division” into Arabic as well as open a nice studio in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Meanwhile, apart from translating FIFA, EA featured local leagues and teams.",
    "whatEssentials-question": "What Are The Essentials Of Game Localization And Game Localization Services?",
    "whatEssentials-anwser1": "The use of LatinIt is good to localize everything, but then, Arabic markets are fine with having Latin figures/numbers rather than Arabic ones and transliterating proper names.",
    "whatEssentials-anwser2": "RTL Text OrientationRight to Left languages means you should not lock (or force) text direction in your game, and the whole interface should be read from left to right. The RTL languages include Arabic, Urdu, and Hebrew, among others, and if the game’s UI is not suited for RTL languages, the necessary effect is reached by game developers who mirror their game.",
    "whatEssentials-anwser3": "Specifications of GenderIt is believed that translation to the Arab World is culturalization 90% and takes an effort of 10%. This is because Arabic gamers enjoy games that contain their celebrities and prominent historical figures. They love games with elements of their culture. FIFA, for one, includes Arabic soccer stars in their Arabic version of the game. Amazing fact: Text can be reduced when translating from Arabic to English and vice versa. The shortened text occurs sometimes because Arabic is an “emotional” language with a lot of word combinations that are used to increase the feelings behind meaning.",
    "whatEssentials-anwser4": "Cultural ContextIt is believed that translation to the Arab World is culturalization 90% and takes an effort of 10%. This is because Arabic gamers enjoy games that contain their celebrities and prominent historical figures. They love games with elements of their culture. FIFA, for one, includes Arabic soccer stars in their Arabic version of the game. Amazing fact: Just to localize the game “Paramanyu” for Middle East and North Africa region, Netmarble oversaw UX tests among 30 groups. The Korean company used the study to discover that users found a huge number of buttons confusing. Netmarble then improved its features and drastically reduced the buttons to 15. They further introduced important characters, maps and landmarks. “Traveling Millionaire” (رحلة المليونير) is the title of the game.",
    "whatEssentials-anwser5": "Some topics are sensitiveIt is important to note that there are several topics that are sensitive when considering video game translation. The use of Quran or Bible verses should be avoided during the process of video games translation. Even so, nudity, homosexuality, explicit sexual scenes, alcohol and religious symbols are things to avoid, too. Game translators usually amend the original or main version of the game if it contains the above mentioned. This is done to avoid offending the government or Arab gamers. It is a no-no to offend Islam. Amazing fact: Some topics that are inappropriate in some countries are accepted elsewhere! Regional differences are key. For instance, a Christmas theme may be accepted in Tunisia or Morocco, but Saudi Arabia will most likely not accept it.",
    "whatEssentials-anwser6": "The Arabic DialectsThe most commonly used dialect in media and education is the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). It’s a language that’s most common in official environments, and as a result, everyone can relate with it. This is a reason game developers use it, even during in-game events in a particular country. For instance, FIFA 2012 has one of the most prominent Tunisian commentators as its voice-over despite being localized into MSA. Meanwhile, certain parts of some games are left in French for North Africa or English. They are not localized. Like the Racing game “Need for Speed”, it contains some parts of the car which are different in various countries. It would have been wrong to leave them in Modern Standard Arabic because not all users will understand what it means or its intended meaning. The governments of 22 countries recognize Arabic language as their official language. Arabic is the 5th most popular language worldwide with about 6% of the world’s population (450Million). Saudi Arabia leads the most appealing Arabic-speaking market, and they are followed by Kuwait, UAE, and Bahrain. So, you see why video game translation is important!",
