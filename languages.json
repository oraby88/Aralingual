Despite\n                    considering this varying factor, it is also good to know the\n                    lucrative smaller populations. For instance, the Arabian\n                    Gulf states are regarded as the smallest when it comes to\n                    population, but the market there is more appealing than that\n                    of Northern African – Morocco and Egypt.",

The\n                      use of Quran or Bible verses should be avoided during the\n                      process of video games translation. Even so, nudity,\n                      homosexuality, explicit sexual scenes, alcohol and\n                      religious symbols are things to avoid, too.

It\n                      would have been wrong to leave them in Modern Standard\n                      Arabic because not all users will understand what it means\n                      or its intended meaning.\n                    \n                    \n                      The governments of 22 countries recognize Arabic language\n                      as their official language. Arabic is the 5th most popular\n                      language worldwide with about 6% of the world’s population\n                      (450Million). Saudi Arabia leads the most appealing\n                      Arabic-speaking market, and they are followed by Kuwait,\n                      UAE, and Bahrain.
